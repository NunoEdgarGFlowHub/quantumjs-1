# quantum-watch

Part of the `quantum-js` library.

This module watches quantum files for changes, and calls a callback when changes are made. It keeps track of @inline entity references, allowing only the files affected by a file change to be rebuilt.

This readme includes no details about how to use the library itself as there is documentation for the library available here: https://quantum.hexagonjs.io.
