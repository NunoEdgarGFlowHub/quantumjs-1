# quantum-template

A module intended for use with `quantum-js`

This module adds the ability to create templates using @define which can then be re-used as entities throughout, the ability to define variables that can be interpolated at render time as well as some entity transforms for basic logic (for loops, if statements).

This readme includes no details about how to use the library itself as there is documentation for the library available here: https://quantum.hexagonjs.io.
