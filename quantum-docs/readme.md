# quantum-docs

A module intended for use with `quantum-js` and `quantum-html`

This module adds a collection of entites that make it easier to write
documentation, providing both layout and visual modifiers such as sidebars,
content sections and a dynamic table of contents.

This readme includes no details about how to use the library itself as there is
documentation for the library available here:
