# quantum-version

A module intended for use with `quantum-js` and `quantum-html`

This module provides a file transform that enables the generation of
incrementally versioned content. The version transform works well with the
`quantum-api` entity transforms for generating versioned api documentation.

This readme includes no details about how to use the library itself as there is
documentation for the library available here:
