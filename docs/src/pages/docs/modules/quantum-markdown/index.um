  @description: A transform for embedding markdown into a Quantum site.

@contentSection
  @topic About
    This module provides the @code[@@markdown] transform for including markdown
    snippets in a quantum site and the @code[@markdown] transform for inlining
    markdown files.

  @topic Example
    @example
      @file
        @@um
          @@markdown
            ### Heading Text

            _italic_ or **bold** text.

    @div .docs-example
      @div .docs-example-heading qm-header-font: HTML Output
      @div .docs-example-body
        @@codeblock html
          <div class="qm-markdown">
            <h3 id="heading-text">Heading Text</h3>
            <p><em>italic</em> or <strong>bold</strong> text.</p>
          </div>

  @topic Markdown File Example
    It is also possible to include markdown inline directly from @code[.md]
    files using @code[@markdown] and @code[@inline]

    @example
      @noOutput
      @@um
        @markdown: @inline path/to/file.md

    Inlining files in this way uses @code[@markdown] as non-quantum files are
    not parsed by quantum when using @code[@inline] (so all the @code[#] for
    headings are retained)

  @notice [Note]
    Always use @code[@@markdown] for markdown blocks and @code[@markdown] when
    inlining markdown files.

    Using @code[@@markdown] prevents the @code[#] character being treated as a
    quantum comment. Since @code[#] is used for headings in markdown it is
    important to do this otherwise they will not show up in the rendered page!

  @topic Markdown Table of Contents
    When using markdown, it is possible to create an automated table of contents
    (toc) for the @code[@@markdown] section you are writing, or for the
    @code[@markdown] file you are inlining.

    To add a table of contents, add @code[<!-- toc -->] to the place in the
    section that you want the toc to be added. This will find all the subsequent
    headings and convert them to a list structure.

    The below example demonstrates using some markdown headings. All @code[#]
    headings will be used for the toc that appear after the @code[<!-- toc -->]:

    @section Example
      @example
        @file
          @@um
            @@markdown
              ### First Heading
              This heading won't display in the table of contents as it is
              before the `toc` comment

              Table of contents will display below here
              <!-- toc -->

              ### First heading in toc

              ### Second Heading in toc

              #### Sub Heading

    The header links and table of contents apply de-duplication so if you have
    multiple headings with the same text, subsequent headings are given a
    numbered suffix.

    As anchors are all converted to lower case, the casing of duplicate headings
    is ignored:

    @section De-duplication example
      @example
        @file
          @@um
            @@markdown
              <!-- toc -->
              # Example
              This heading has anchor `#example`
              ## example
              This heading has anchor `#example-1`
              # example
              This heading has anchor `#example-2`
              ## Example
              This heading has anchor `#example-3`

    @notice [Special Characters]
      The special characters @code[~!@#$%^&*(){}[]=:/\,;?+\'"] will be removed
      from the header links to make them both URL safe and easy to follow.

      Other characters, such as Chinese letters, will be uri encoded (e.g.
      from @code[Âçé] to @code[%E5%8D%8E])

  @topic Cheatsheet
    Examples pulled from the
    @hyperlink(https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)[Markdown Cheatsheet]
    and combined into a single example:

    @example
      @@um
        @@markdown
          # H1
          ## H2
          ### H3
          #### H4
          ##### H5
          ###### H6

          Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:

          Alt-H1
          ======

          Alt-H2
          ------

          Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

          Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

          Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

          Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

          1. First ordered list item
          2. Another item
            * Unordered sub-list.
          1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
            1. Ordered sub-list
          4. And another item.

             You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

             To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.
             Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.
             (This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

          * Unordered list can use asterisks
          - Or minuses
          + Or pluses

          Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

          URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
          http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes
          example.com (but not on Github, for example).

          Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

          Here's our logo (hover to see the title text):

          Inline-style:

          Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

          ```javascript
          var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
          alert(s);
          ```

          ```python
          s = "Python syntax highlighting"
          print s
          ```

          ```
          No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
          But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
          ```

          Colons can be used to align columns.

          | Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
          | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
          | col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
          | col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
          | zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

          There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
          The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
          raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

          Markdown | Less | Pretty
          --- | --- | ---
          *Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
          1 | 2 | 3

          > Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
          > This line is part of the same quote.

          Quote break.

          > This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.

          ## Horizontal Rule

          Three or more...

          Hyphens

          ***

          Asterisks

          ___

          Underscores

          Here's a line for us to start with.

          This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

          This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
          This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.
