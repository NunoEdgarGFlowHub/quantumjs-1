# quantum-changelog

A transform for the `quantum-js` library

This module provides a set of transforms for creating a changelog as well as the @process transform that allows the generation of a changelog from versioned content.

This readme includes no details about how to use the library itself as there is documentation for the library available here: https://quantum.hexagonjs.io.
