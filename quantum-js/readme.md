# quantum-js

The core module for the [QuantumJS](https://ocadotechnology.github.io/quantumjs/)
collection.

This module consists of a cli (command line interface), a parser for the markup
language, a selection api for working with the parsed AST (abstract syntax tree)
and an api for watching quantum files for changes.

This is module contains all the low level stuff that makes everything else work.
