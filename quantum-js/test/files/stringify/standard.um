@about
  When passing the contents of this file through parsing and restringifying the
  contents should be the same, eg:

  @code js
    const parsed = quantum.parse("standard.um")
    const stringified = quantum.stringify(parsed)

    // standard.um and stringified should look the same

@entity param1 param2
  Some content

  @subentity param: Single line strings should go on one line

  @multipleLineStringHandling param
    This content should remain
    as multiple lines when parsed
    and stringified

  @sameLineContent: Same line content

  @tag
  @entities
  @should
  @not
  @have
  @trailing
  @colons
  @even with params

Standalone text at the top level should be fine
